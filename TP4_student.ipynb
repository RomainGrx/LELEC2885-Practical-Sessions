Light fires simultaneously at all points along the boundary of this region and watch the fire move into the interior. At points where the fire traveling from two different boundaries meets itself, the fire will extinguish itself and the points at which this happens form the so called _quench line_. This line is the skeleton. Under this definition it is clear that thinning produces a sort of skeleton.\n",
